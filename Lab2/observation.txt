// Title: Lab2 – observations
// Description: This is the observations that I made.

2: I observe that most of the output alternates between the parent and child processes. I also notice that the for loop make it so that every iteration from 0 to 9 totaling 10 will include it's iteration number. The parent printed first pretty consistantly for almost all of them except for one.
4: I observe that longer delay make it slower to output and also make the result irreliable, everytime I run it again it seem to change the output order slightly.
